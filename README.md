# odin-recipes

Welcome to my journey through The Odin Project’s foundational course, where I’ve embarked on the delightful “Project: Odin Recipes”. This project is a hands-on exercise designed to solidify my HTML skills by building a basic yet functional recipe website.

The essence of this project lies in its simplicity and focus on the core structure of web pages. By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated my ability to:

* Create and organize HTML documents, establishing a clear hierarchy and structure.
* Implement links between pages, allowing for seamless navigation through the website’s content.
* Utilize images to enhance the visual appeal and provide context to the recipes.
* Craft descriptive text that is both informative and engaging, guiding visitors through the cooking process.

This project may not win design awards with its initial brutalist aesthetic, but it’s a stepping stone towards mastering the building blocks of web development. As I progress, I’ll revisit this project to embellish it with CSS, transforming it into a feast for the eyes as well as the palate.

Stay tuned to witness the transformation from a basic HTML skeleton to a beautifully styled culinary showcase
